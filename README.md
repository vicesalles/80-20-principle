# 80/20 Tables

## What

A React Component which diplays data sets in tables based on the 80/20 principle

## Why

Just read the Richard Koch's 80/20 principle book and got curious about the insights it may provide.

"80/20 analysis examines the relationship between two sets of comparable data. One set of data is always a universe of people that can be turned into a percentage. The other set of data relates to some interesting characteristic of the people or objects that can be measured and also turned into a percentage."

## Demo

In the demo you can check some data about the Spanish Football League. (Actual Football, not that creepy rugby). Funny to say that the 80/20 principle turns falsy with this data set.
